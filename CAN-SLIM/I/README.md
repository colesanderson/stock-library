## I = Institutional Sponsorship

 It takes big demand to push up prices, and by far the biggest source of demand for stocks is institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, large investment counselors, bank trust, departments, and state, charitable and educational institutions. These large investors account for the lion's share of each day's market activity.

 Institutional sponsorship refers to the shares of any stock owned by such institutions. For measurements purposes, I have never considered brokerage research reports or analysts recommendations as institutional sponsorship, although a few may exert short-term influence on some securities for a few days.

 **Look for Both Quality and Increasing Numbers of Buyers**

 Diligent investors dig down yet another level. They want to know not only how many institutional sponsors a stock has, but whether that number has steadily increased in recent quarters, and, more important, whether the most recent quarter showed a materially large increase in the number of owners.

 In analyzing the recorded quality of a stock's institutional sponsorship, the latest 12 months plus the last three years of the investment performance of mutual fund sponsors are usually most relevant. A quick and easy way to get this information is by checking a mutual fund's 36 months performance rating in investors business daily. B+ or higher are considered the better performance.

 **Buy Companies That Show Increasing Sponsorship**

It's less crucial to know how many institutions owns a stock than to know which of the limited number of better-performing institutions own a stock or have bought it recently.

**Note New Stock Positions Bought in the Last Quarter**

A significant new position taken by a institutional investor in the most recently reported period is generally more relevant than existing positions that have been held for some time.

**Is Your Stock "Over owned" by Insititutions**

 **An Unassailable Institutional Growth Stock Tops**

 Some stocks may seem invincible, but the old saying is true: what goes up must eventually come down. No company is forever immune to management problems, economic slowdowns, and changes in market direction.

 The lesson: don't be swayed by a stock's broad-based popularity or an analyst advising investors to buy stocks on the way down in price.

 **Institutional Sponsorship Means Market Liquidity**

 Another benefit to you as an individual investor is that institutional sponsorship provides buying support when you want to sell your investment.

 ### In Summary:

 Buy only those stocks that have at least a few institutional sponsors with better-than-average recent performance records and that have added institutional owners in recent quarters.
