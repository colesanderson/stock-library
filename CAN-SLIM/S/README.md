## S = Supply and Demand: Big Volume Demand at Key Points

The price of almost everything in your daily life is determined by the law of supply and demand.

The basic principle of supply and demand also applies to the stock market, where it is most important than the opinions of all the analysts on Wall Street.

**Big and Small Supply of Stock**

If you are choosing between two stocks to buy, one with 5 billion shares outstanding and the other with 50 million, the smaller one will usually be the better performance, if other factors are equal. However, since smaller-cap-italization stocks are less liquid, they can come down as fast as they go up, sometimes even faster.

The total number of shares outstanding in a company's capital structure represents the potential amount of stock available.

Big-cap stocks do have some advantages: greater liquidity, generally less downside volatility, better quality, and in some cases less risk.

**Pick Entrepreneurial Management Rather than Caretakers**

Big companies may seem to have a great deal of power and influence, but size often begets a lack of imagination and productive efficiency.

**Excessive Stock Splits May Hurt**

From time to time, companies make the mistake of splitting their stocks excessively.

It's usually better for a company to split it's shares 2 for 1 or 3 for 2 rather than split them 3 for 1 or 5 for 1.
Oversized split create a substantially larger supply and may put a company in the more lethargic, big-cap status sooner.

A stock will often reach a price top around the second or third time it splits. Our study of the biggest winners found that only 18% of them had splits in the year preceding their great price advances.

**Look for Companies Buying Their Own Stock in the Open Market**

In most but not all cases, it's usually a good sign where a company, especially a small- to -medium-sized growth company that meets the CAN SLIM criteria buys its own stock in the open market consistently over a period of time.

This reduces the number of shares and usually implies that the company expects improved sales and earnings in the future.

**Low Corporate Debt-to-Equity Ratio is Generally Better**

After you have found a stock with reasonable number of shares, check the percentage of the company's total capitalization represented by long-term debt or bonds.

Usually, the lower the debt ratio, the safer and better the company. The earnings per share of companies with high debt-to-equity ratio could be clobbered in difficult periods when interest rates are high or during more severe recessions.

Rule 1 for all competent investors and homeowners is never ever borrow more than you can pay back. Excessive debt hurt people, companies, and government.

**Evaluating Supply and Demand**

The best way to measure a stock's supply and demand is by watching it's daily trading volume. These measurements, plus a proprietary rating of the degree of recent accumulation or distribution in the stock, are invaluable pieces of information that are available in no other daily publication, including the Wall Street journal.

When a stock breaks out of a price consolidation area, trading volume should be at least 40% or 50% above normal.

Stock of any size capitalization can be bought using the CAN SLIM system. But small-cap stocks will not be substantially more volatile, both on the upside and on the downside. From time to time, the market will shift its emphasis from small to large caps and vice versa. Companies that are buying back their stock in the open market and that show considerable stock ownership by management are preferred.
