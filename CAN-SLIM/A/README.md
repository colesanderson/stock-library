## A = Annual Earnings Increases: Look for Big Growth

The way to do that is by reviewing the company's annual earnings growth rate.

Look for annual earnings per share that have increased in each of the last three years.

**Select Stocks with 25% to 50% and Higher Annual Earnings Growth Rates**

The annual rate of earnings growth for the companies you pick should be 25%, 50%, or even 100% or more.

Big winners showed at least some positive annual growth over the thee years, and in some cases the five years, preceding the stocks' big run-ups.

A typical earnings per share progression for the five years preceding the stock's move might be something like: $0.70, $1.15, $1.85, $2.65, and $4.00.

**Look for a Big Return on Equity**

You should also be aware of two other measurements of profitability and growth: return on equity and cash flow per share.

This shows how efficiently a company uses its money thereby helping to separate well-mainaged firms from those that are poorly managed.

Greatest growth stocks of the past 50 years had ROEs of at least 17%.

**Check the Stability of a Company's Three-Year Earnings Record**

Through our research, we've determined another factor that has proved important in selecting growth stocks: the stability and consistency of annual earnings growth over the past three years.

Growth stocks with steady earnings tend to have stability figure below 20 or 25.

**What is a Normal Stock Market Cycle?**

History demonstrates most bull (up) markets last two to four years and are followed by a recession or a bear (down) market.

The combination of a general market decline and a stock's continued profit growth will have compressed the price/earnings (P/E) ratio to a point where it is attractive to institutional investors, for whom P/E are important.

Cyclical stocks in basic industries such as steel, chemicals, paper, rubber, autos and machinery usually lag in the new bull market's early phase.

**How to Weed Out the Losers in a Group**

The stock of a company that has outstanding three-year growth record of 30% but whose earnings growth has slowed to 10% to 15% in the last several quarters acts like a fully mature growth stock.

**Insist on Both Annual and Current Quarterly Earnings Being Excellent**

A standout stock needs both sound growth record in recent years and a strong current earnings record in the last several quarters.

The fastest way to find a company with strong and accelerating current earnings and solid three-year growth is by checking the proprietary Earnings per Share (EPS) Rating provided for every stock listed in Investors' Business Daily research stock tables. Scale is from 1 to 99, with 99 being best.

**Are Price/Earnings Ratios Really Important?**

For years, analysts have used P/E ratios as their base measurement tool in deciding whether a stock is undervalued (has a low P/E) and should be bought, or is overvalued (has a high P/E) and should be sold.

Primary consideration should be given to whether the rate of change earnings is substantially increasing or decreasing.

Beginning P/E for most big winners ranged from 25 to 5, and the P/E expansions varied from 60 to 115.

**Why You Missed Some Fabulous Stocks!**

High P/Es, for example, were found to occur because of bull markets. Low P/Es, with the exception of those on cyclical stocks, generally occurred because of bear markets.

**How Price/Earnings Ratios Are Misused**

Many Wall Street analysts put a stock on their "buy" list because it's selling at the low end of its historical P/E range.

Reliance on P/E ratios often ignores more basic trends.

One way I do sometimes use P/E ratios is to estimate the potential price objective for a growth stock over the next 6 to 18 months based on its estimated future earnings.

**Don't Sell High-P/E Stocks Short**

So much for opinions about P/Es being too high! Investors personal opinions are usually wrong; the market is almost always right. So stop fighting and arguing with the market.
Concentrate on stocks with proven records of significant earnings growth in each of the last three years plus strong recent quarterly improvements. Don't accept anything less.
