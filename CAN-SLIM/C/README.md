## C = Current Bid or Accelerating Quarterly Earnings and Sales per Share

**Seek Stocks Showing Huge Current Earnings Increase**

In our models of the 600 best-performing stocks from 1952 to 2001, three out of four showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the latest publicly reported quarter before they began their major advances.

Those that did not show solid current quarterly earnings increases did so in the very next quarter, with an average earnings increase of 90%.

The earnings per share (EPS) number you want to focus on is calculated by dividing a company's total after-tax profits by the number of common shares outstanding. This percentage change in EPS is the single most important element in stock selection today. The **greater** the percentage increase, the better!

**Watch Out for Misleading Earnings Reports**

How much are the current quarter's earnings per share up (in percentage terms) from the same quarter the year before?

You should always compare a company's earnings per share to the same quarter a year earlier, not to the prior quarter, to avoid any distortion resulting from seasonality. In other words, you don't compare the December quarter's earnings per share to the prior September quarter's earnings per share. Rather, compare the December quarter to the December quarter of the previous year for a more accurate evaluation.

**Omit a Company's One-Time Extraordinary Gains**

The winning investors should avoid the trap of being influenced by nonrecurring profits. Such earnings represent a one-time event, not the true, ongoing profitability of corporate operations.

**Set a Minimum Level of Current Earnings Increases***

I would advise against buying any stock that doesn't show earnings per share up at least 18% or 20% in the most recent quarter versus the same quarter the year before. Many successful investors use 25% or 30% as their minimum earnings parameter.

To further sharpen your stock selection process, look ahead to the next quarter or two and check the earnings that were reported for those same quarters the previous year.

**Avoid Big Older Companies with Maintainer Management**

True growth companies with outstanding new products or improved management do not have to inflate their current results.

**Look for Accelerating Quarterly Earnings Growth**

Our analysis of the most successful stocks also showed that, in almost every case, earnings growth accelerated sometime in the 10 quarters before a towering price move began.

**Look for Sales Growth as Well as Earnings Growth**

Strong and improving quarterly earnings should always be supported by sales growth of at least 25% for the last quarter, or at least accelerated in the rate of sales percentage improvement over the last three quarters.

**Two Quarterly of Major Earnings Deceleration Can Be Trouble for Your Stock**

**Consult Log-Scale Weekly Graphs**

Securities analysts who recommended stocks because of the absolute level of earnings expected for the following year could be looking at the wrong set of numbers.

Logarithmic-scale graph are of great value in analyzing stocks because the clearly show the acceleration of deceleration in the percentage rate of quarterly earnings increases.

**Check Other Stocks in the Group**

**Very important note:**

Current quarterly earnings per share should be up a major percentage of 25% to 50% at a minimum over the same quarter the previous year. The best companies might show earnings up to 100% to 500% or more!
