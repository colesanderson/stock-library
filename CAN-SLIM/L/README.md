## L = Leader or Laggard: Which Is Your Stock?

People tend to buy stocks that make them feel either good or comfortable. But in a bull market populated by dynamic leaders that just keep surprising on the upside, these sentimental favorites often turn out to be the dullest laggards.

**Buy Among the Best Two or Three Stocks in a Group**

The top one, two, or three stocks in a strong industry group can have unbelievable growth, while others in the pack may hardly stir.

By the number one, I don't mean the largest company or the one with the most recognized brand, I mean the one with the best quarterly and annual earnings growth, the highest return on equity, the widest profit margins, the strongest sales growth and the most dynamic stock-rice action.

**Avoid Sympathy Stock Moves**

A sympathy play in a stock in the same industry group that is bought in the hope that the luster of the lead leader will rub off on it. The stocks will eventually try to move up "in sympathy" with the leader, but they never do as well.

**How to Separate the Leaders from the Laggards: Using Relative Price Strength**

If you own a portfolio of stocks, you must learn to sell the worst performers first and keep the best a little longer. In the other words, always sell your mistakes while the loss is still small, and watch your better selections to see if they progress into your big winners.

The Relative Price Strength Rating is shown each day for all stock listed in Investors's Business Daily's stock tables.

**Pick 80s and 90s That Are in Sound and Proper Chart Base Patterns**

If you wan to upgrade your stock selection so that you are zeroing in on the leaders, restrict your purchase to companies showing RS Rating of 80 or higher.

**Finding New Leaders during Market Corrections**

Correction or price declines, in the general market can help you recognize new leaders - if you know what to look for. The most desirable growth stocks normally correct 1 and half to 2 and half times the general market averages.

Say the general market averages suffers an intermediate-term correction of 10%, and three of your successful growth stocks come off 15%, 25%, and 35%.

**Look for Abnormal Strength on a Weak Market Day**

It seldom pays to invest in laggard stocks, even if they look tantalizingly cheap. Look for, and confine your purchases to, market leaders. Get out of your laggard losers if you are down **8% below the price** you paid so you won't risk getting badly hurt.
