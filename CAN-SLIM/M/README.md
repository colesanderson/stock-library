## M = Market Direction: How You Can Determine It

You can be right about every one of the factors in the last six chapters, but if you are wrong about the direction of the general market, and that direction is down, three out of four of your stocks will plummet along with the market averages, and you will certainly lose money big time, as many people did in 2000 and again in 2008.

The best way for you to determine the direction of the market is to look carefully at, follow, interpret, and understand the daily charts of the three or four major general market averages and what their price and volume changes are doing on a day-to-day basis.

**What Is The General Market?**

The general market is a term referring to the most commonly used market indexes. These broad indexes tell you the approximate strength or weakness in each day's overall trading activity and can be one of your earliest indications of emerging trends.

* The Standard & Poor 500 (S&P 500) - Consisting of 500 companies
* Nasdaq Composite - home to many of the market's younger and more innovative and faster-growing companies.
* The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) - 30 widely traded big-cap stocks, eg. Coca-Cola, Home Depot, etc. It change over time.
* The NYSE Composite (NYA) - market-value-weighted index of all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

**Why Is Skilled, Careful Market Observation So Important?**

If you want to learn about the market, you must observe and study the major indexes carefully.

To know which way it's going, you must observe and analyze the major general market indexes daily. Learn to accurately read what the market is actually doing each day as it is doing it.

**The Stags of a Stock Market Cycle**

The winning investor should understand how a normal business cycle unfolds and over what period of time.

The investors should pay particular attention to recent cycles. There is no guarantee that just because cycles lasted three of four years in the past, they will last long in the future.

The stock market is leading economic indicator, not coincident or lagging indicator, in our government's series of key economic indicators.

It is action is determined by millions of investors all across the country and thousands of large institutions and is consensus conclusion on whether it likes or does not like what is foresees - such as what government is doing or about to do and what the consequences could be.

**You Should Study the General Market Indexes Each Day**

In bear markets, stocks usually open strong and close weak. In bull markets, they tend to open weak and close strong. The general market averages need to be checked every day, since reverses in trends can begin on any given few days.

Your best bet is to learn to interpret daily price and volume charts of the key general market averages. If you do, you can not get too far off-track, and you won't need much else. Experience teaches that second-guessing the market can be very expensive mistake.

**A 33% Drop Requires a 50% Rise to Break Even**

The importance of knowing the direction of the general market cannot be overemphasized. If you have 33% loss in a portfolio of stocks, you need a 50% gain to get your breakeven point. If, for example, you have allowed a $10,000 portfolio to drop $6,666 (33% decline), it has to rise $3,333 (or 50%) just to get back where you started.

**The Myths about "Long-Term Investing" and Being Fully Invested**

Many investors like to think of, or at least describe, themselves as "long term investors". Their strategy is to stay fully invested through thick and thin. But such as inflexible approach can have tragic result, particularly for individual investors.

**Protecting Yourself from Market Downturns**

After you see the first several definite indications of a market top, don't wait around. Sell quickly before real weakness develops. When market indexes peak and begin major downside reversals, you should act immediately by putting 25% or more of your portfolio in cash, selling your stocks at market prices.

In the final analysis, there are really only two things you can do when a new bear market begins: sell and retreat or go short. When you retreat, you stay out until the bear market is over. This usually means five to six months or more.

**How You Can Learn to Identify Stock Market Tops**

To detect a market top, keep close eye to the daily S&P 500, NYSE Composite, DOW 30, and Nasdaq Composite as they work their way higher.

Normal liquidation near the market peak will usually occur on three to five specific days over a period of four or five weeks. In other words, the market comes under distribution while it is advancing!

**After the Initial Decline off the Top, Track Each Rally Attempt on the Way Down**

After the required number of days of increase volume distribution around the top and the first decline resulting from this, there will be either a poor rally in the market averages, followed by a rally failure, or a positive and powerful follow-through day up on price and volume.

Another sign of abnormal activity is the "climax" top. Here, a leading stock will run up more rapidly for two or three weeks in a row, after having advanced for many months.

**Other Bear Market Warnings**

Many top reversals (when the market closes at the bottom of its trading range after making a new high that day) have occurred between the third and the ninth day of rally after the averages moved into new high ground off small chart bases (meaning that the time span from the start to the end of the pattern was really too short). It's important to note that the conditions under which the tops occurred were all about the same.

**Don't Jump Back In Too Early**

When you make a mistake in the stock market, the only sound thing to do is to correct it. Don't fight it. Pride and ego never pay off; either does vacillation when losses start to show up.

**How You Can Spot Stock Market Bottoms**

Once yo have recognized a bear market and have scaled back your stock holdings, the big questions is how long you should remain on the sidelines. If you plunge back into the market too soon, the apparent rally may fade, and you will lose money.

Don't jump back in right away. Wait for the market itself to confirm the new uptrend.

**The Big Money is Made in the First Two Years**

The really big money is usually made in the first one or two years of normal new bull market cycle. It's at this point that you must always recognize, and fully capitalize upon., the golden opportunity presented.

Normal bear markets show three legs of price movement down, but there is no rule saying you can't have four or even five down legs. You have to evaluate overall conditions and events in the country objectively and let the market averages tell their own story. And you have to understand what that story is.

**Additional Ways to Identify Key Market Turning Points**

* Looking for Divergence of Key Averages

Meaning that they are moving in different directions(one up and one down) or that one index is advancing or declining at a much greater rate than another.

* Certain Psychological Market Indicators Might at Times Help

The percentage of investment advisors who are bearish is an interesting measure of investor sentiment.

* Interpret the Overrated Advance-Decline Line

These technicians take the number of stocks advancing each day versus the number that are declining, and then plot that ratio on a graph. 

* Watch Federal Reserve Board Rate Changes

* The Hourly Market Index and Volume Change

At key turning points, an active market operator can watch the market indexes and volume changes hour by hour and compare them to volume in the same hour of the day before.
* Overbought and Oversold: Two Risky words

* Other General Market Indicators

Upside/downside volume is a short-term index that relates to trading volume in stocks that close up in price for the day to trading volume in stocks that close down.

This index, plotted as a 10-week moving average, may show divergence at some intermediate turning points in the market.
