**The Stock Market's "Great Paradox"**

There is another fascinating phenomenon we found in the early stage of all winning stocks. We call it the "Great Paradox".

Our study of the greatest stock market winners proved that the old adage "buy low, sell high" was completely wrong. In fact, our study proved the exact opposite.

A stock making the new-high list - especially one making the list for the first time while trading on big volume during a bull market - might be a prospect with big potential.

**How Does a Stock Go from $50 to $100?**

As a smart investor, your job is to buy when a stock looks too high to the majority of conventional investors and sell after it moves substantially higher and finally begins to look attractive to some of those same investors.

**The Correct Time to Begin Buying a Stock**

Using stock charts is an important piece of the stock selection process.

These correctly created breakouts are the points at which most really big price advances begin and the possibility of a significant price move is the greatest.

**Answers to the Market's Great Paradox**

Search for companies that have developed important new products or services, or that have benefited from new management or materially improved industry conditions. Then buy their stocks when they are emerging from sound, correctly analyzed price consolidation patterns and are close to, or actually making, new price highs on increased volume.
