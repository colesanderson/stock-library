# Read Charts

Chart patterns, or "base", are simply areas of price correction and solidation after an earlier price advance. Most of them (80% - 90%) are created and formed as a result of corrections in the general market.

As a individual investor, you too need to study and benefit from stock charts. It's not enough to buy a stock simply because it has good fundamental characteristics, like strong earnings and sales.

Winning stocks, they all had seven common characteristics, which can be summarized in the two easy-to-remember words CAN SLIM.

## Most Common Chart Patter: "Cup with Handle"

One of the most important price patterns looks like a cup with handle when the outline of the cup is viewed from the side.

Cup patterns can last from 7 weeks to as long as 65 weeks, but most of them last for three to six months. Price pattern varies from around the 12% to 15% range to upwards of 33%.

The bottom part of the cup should be rounded and give the appearance of a "U" rather than a very narrow "V"

The "U" area is important because it scares out or wears out the remaining weak holders and takes other speculators' attention away from the stock.

Historical research has shown that stocks that make new price highs after such huge moves tend to fail 5% to 15% beyond their breakouts prices. Stocks that come straight off the bottom into new highs off cups can be more risky because they had no pullbacks.

A price drop in a proper handle should be contained within 8% to 12% of its peak during bull markets unless the stock forms a very large cap, as in the rather unusual case of Sea Containers in 1975.

## Constructive Patterns Have Tight Price Areas

There should also be at least some tight areas in the price patterns of stocks under accumulation. On a weekly chart, tightness is defined as small price variations from high to low for the week, with several consecutive weeks' prices closing unchanged or remarkably near the previous week's close.

## Find Pivot Point and Watch "Volume Percent Change"

When a stock forms a proper cup-with handle chart pattern and then charges through an upside buy point, which Jesse Livermore referred to as the "pivot point" or "line of least resistance", the day's volume should increase at least 40% to 50% above normal.

Your objective is not to buy at the cheapest price or near the low, but to begin buying at exactly the right time, when your chances for success are greatest.

You want a stock to prove its strength to you before you invest in it. Also, if you buy at more than 5% to 10% past the precise buy point, you are buying late and will more than likely get caught in the next price correction.

## Look for Volume Dry-Ups Near the Lows of a Price Pattern

Nearly all proper bases will show a dramatic drying up of a volume for one or two weeks along the very low of the base pattern and in the low area or few last weeks of the handle.

This means that all of the selling has been exhausted and there is very little stock coming into the marketplace.

Healthy stocks that are under accumulation almost always show this symptom.

## Big Volume Clue Are Valuable

Another clue that is valuable to the trained chart specialist is the occurrence of big daily and weekly volume spikes. Weeks of advancing prices on heavy volume, followed in other weeks by extreme volume dry-ups, are also a very constructive sign.

Volume is a remarkable subject that is worthy of careful study. It can help you recognize whether a stock is under accumulation (Institutional buying) or distribution (inititutional selling).

Volume is your best measure of supply and demand and institutional sponsorship - two vital ingredients in successful stock analysis. Learn how to use charts to time your purchase correctly.

## The Value of Market Corrections

Since 80% to 90% of price patterns are created during periods of market corrections, you should never get discouraged and give up on the stock market's potential during the intermediate-term sell-offs or short or prolonged bear markets.

Bear markets can last as little as three, six or nine months or as long as two or in rare cases, three years.

A bear market is the time to do a post analysis of your prior decisions. Plot on daily or weekly charts exactly where you bought and sold all the stocks you traded in the past year. Study your decisions and write out some new rules that will let you avoid the mistakes you made in the past cycle.

Develop some rules to make sure that you buy the real leaders and handle them right in the next bull market cycle.

## Other Price Patterns to Look For

**How to Spot a "Sauce-with-Handle" Price Pattern**

A "saucer with handle" is a price pattern similar to the cup with handle except that the saucer part tends to stretch out over a longer period of time, making the pattern shallower.

**Recognize a "Double-Bottom" Price Pattern**

A "double-bottom" price pattern looks like the letter "W". This pattern is also doesn't occur quite as often as the cup with handle, but it still occurs frequently.

It is usually important that the second bottom of the W match the price level (low) of the first bottom, or as in almost all cases, clearly undercut it by one or two points, thereby creating a shakeout of weaker investors.

**Definition of a "Flat-Rate" Price Structure**

A flat base is another rewarding price structure. It is usually a second-stage base that occurs after a stock has advanced 20% or more off a cup with handle, saucer with handle, or a double bottom.

The flat base moves straight sideways in fairly tight price range for at least five or six weeks, and it does not correct more than 10% to 15%.

**High, Tight Flags Are Rare**

A "high, tight flag" price pattern is rare, occurring in no more than a few stocks during a bull market. It begins with the stock moving generally 100% to 120% in a very short period of time (four to eight weeks). It then corrects sideway no more than 10% to 25%, usually in three, four, or five weeks.

**What is a Base on Top of a Base?**

During the latter stages of a bear market, a seemingly negative condition flags what may be aggressive new leadership in the new bull phase.

**Ascending Base**

Ascending bases, like flat base, occur midway along a move up after a stock has broken out of a cup-with-handle or double-bottom base. They have three pullbacks from 10% to 20% with each low point during the sell-off in price being higher than a preceding once.

## Detecting Faulty Price Patterns and Base Structures

The exception of high, tight flags, which are extremely rare and hard to interpret, flat bases of five or six weeks, and the square box of four to seven weeks, the most reliable base pattern must have a minimum of seven to eight weeks of price consolidation.  

## How to Use Relative Price Strength correctly

Many fundamental securities analysts think that technical analysis means buying those stocks with the strongest relative price strength. Others think that technical research refers only to the buying of "high-momentum" stocks. Both views are incorrect.

You should buy stocks that are performing better than the general market just as they are beginning to emerge from sound base-building periods.

## What is Overhead Supply?

A critically important concept to learn in analyzing price movements is the principle of overhead supply. Overhead supply is when there are significant areas of price resistance in a stock as it moves up after experiencing a downtrend.

These areas of resistance represent prior purchases of a stock and serve to limit and frustrate its upward movement because the investors who made these purchases are motivated to sell when the price returns to their entry point.
