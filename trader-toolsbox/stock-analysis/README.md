# Stock Analysis

Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are the two most important methods of analyzing a stock's worth.

Technical analysis looks at the price movement of the company's stock and attempt to use this data to predict the future price movements of the security.

Fundamental analysis examines economic and fiscal factors such as financial statements, management roster, competitiveness and relevancy.

## Technicals vs Fundamentals

A technician makes decision based on chart analysis, while fundamental analysis relies on financial statements.
