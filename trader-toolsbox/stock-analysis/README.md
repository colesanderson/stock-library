# Stock Analysis

Technical analysis and fundamental analysis are the two most important methods of analyzing a stock's worth.

Technical analysis looks at the price movement of the company's stock and attempt to use this data to predict the future price movements of the security.

Fundamental analysis examines economic and fiscal factors such as financial statements, management roster, competitiveness and relevancy.

## Technicals vs Fundamentals

A technician makes decision based on chart analysis, while fundamental analysis relies on financial statements. By looking at its balance sheet, cash flow statement and income statement, a fundamental analysts determines a company's value.

Technicians believe that the information necessary to make decision about a stock can be found in its technical trading patterns and that by studying the stock's historical price trends, it is possible to predict price action in the immediate future.

## The Importance of Time Frames

Fundamental analysis takes a long-term approach to analyzing investments in contrast to technical analysis. A company's fundamental can take years to be reflected in a stock's price, while charting technical patterns traders can use time frames ranging from 1 minute to a year.

Financial statements are filled quarterly and changes in earnings per share don't emerge on a daily basis like price and volume do.

Technical analysis allows a trader to take advantage of short term price movements in stocks.

## Trading Versus Investing

Not only is technical analysis more short term in nature than fundamental analysis, but also the goal for the purchase of a stock is usually different for each approach.

Investors buy assets they believe can increase in value, while traders buy assets they believe they can sell to somebody else at a higher price.

If used properly, technical analysis can markedly increase the probability of profitable results.
