# Industry Analysis

## Two different industry categories:

**Cyclial industries**

Industries whose fortunes rise and fall with the economy's rise and fall. If the economy is doing well and the stock market is doing well, consumers and investors are confident and tend to spend and invest more money than usual, so **cyclial industries** tend to do well.

**Defensive industries**

Industries that produce goods and services that are needed no matter what is happening in the economy. A good example is food, utilities and healthcare.

How do defensive stocks grow?

* Population growth: As more and more consumers are born, more people become available to buy essential goods and services.

* New markets: A company can grow by seeking out new groups of consumers to buy its products and services.

## What are the leading companies in the industry?

**Established leaders**

These companies are considered industry leaders or have large share of the market. Investing in these companies is the safer way to go.

**Innovators**

If the industry is hot and you want to be more aggressive in your approach, investigate companies that offer new products, patents, or technologies.

## How can governance action help an industry?

**Deregulation and/or tax decreases**

Parliament sometimes reduces burdens on an industry.

**Direct funding**

Government has the power to steer taxpayer money toward business as well. For example, government can provide tax credits for alternative energy.
