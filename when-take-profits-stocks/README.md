# When to Sell and Take Your Worthwhile profits

If you don't sell early, you will be late. The object is to make and take significant gains and not get excited, optimistic, greedy, or emotionally carried away as your stock's advance gets stronger. Keep in mind the old saying: "Bulls make money and bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered".

## You Must Develop a Profit-and-Loss Plan

To be a big success in the stock market, you need definite rules and a profit-and-loss plan.

## Jack Dreyfus Was a Chartist

First rules he made in 1960 were as follows:

1. Concentrate on listed stocks that sell for more than $20 a share with at least some institutional acceptance.

2. Insist that the company show increases in earnings per share in each of past five years and that the current quartely earnings are up at least 20%.

3. Buy when the stock is making or about to make a new high in price after emerging from a sound correction and price consolidation period. This breakout should be accompanied by a volume increase to at least 50% above the stock's average daily volume.

## My Revised Profit-and-Loss Plan

As a result of my analysis, I discovered that successful stocks, after breaking out of a proper base, tend to move up 20% to 25%. Then they usually decline, build new bases, and in some cases resume their advances. With this new knowledge in mind, I made a rule that I'd buy each stock exactly at the pivot buy point and have the discipline not to pyramid or add to my position at more than 5% past that point. Then I would sell each stock when it was up 20%, while it was still advancing.

So, I made an absolutely important exception to the "sell at +20% rule": if the stock was so powerful that is vaulted 20% in only one, two or three weeks, it had to be held for at least 8 weeks.

If a stock fell below it's purchase price by 8%, I would sell it and take the loss.

## How I Discovered the General Market System

Another exceedingly profitable observation I made from analyzing every one of my money-losing, out-of-ignorance mistakes was that most of my market-leading stocks that topped had done so because the general market started into a decline of 10% or more.

## Two Things to Remember about Selling

1. Buying precisely right solves most of your selling problems. If you buy at exactly the right time off a proper daily or weekly chart base in the first place, and you do not chase or pyramid a stock when it is extended in price more than 5% past a correct pivot buy point, you will be in a position to sit through most normal corrections. Winning stocks very rarely drops 8% below a correct pivot buy point.

2. Beware of the big-block selling you might see on a ticker tape or your PC just after you buy a stock during a bull market. The selling might be emotional, uninformed, temporary, or not as large as it appears. The best stocks can have sharp sell-offs for a few days or a week.

## Technical Sell Signs

### Climax Tops

1. **Largest daily price run-up** - If a stock's price is extended - that is, if it's had a significant run-up for many months from its buy point off a sound and proper base - and it closes for the day with larger price increase on any previous up day since the beginning of the whole move up, watch out!

2. **Heaviest daily volume** - The ultimate top might occur on the heaviest volume day since the beginning of the advance.

3. **Exhaustion gap** - If a stock that is been advancing rapidly is greatly extended from its original base many months ago (at least 18 weeks) and then opens on a gap up in price from the previous day's close, the advance is near its peak.

4. **Climax top activity** - Sell if a stock's advance gets so active that it has a pyramid price run-up for two or three weeks on a weekly chart, or for 7 of 8 days in a row or 8 of 10 days on daily chart.

5. **Signs of distribution** - After a long advance, heavy daily volume with out further upside price progress signals distribution.

6. **Stock splits** - Sell if a stock runs up 25% to 50% for one or two weeks on a stock split.

7. **Increase in consecutive down days** - For most stocks, the number of consecutive down days in price relative to up days in price will probably increase when the stock starts down from its top. 4 or 5 days down, followed by 2 or 3 days up.

8. **Upper channel line** - Sell if a stock goes through its upper channel line after a huge run-up.

9. **200-day moving average line**

10. **Selling on the way down from the top**

## Low Volume and Other Weak Action

1. **New highs on low volume** - Some stocks will make new highs on lower poor volume.   

2. **Closing at or neat the day's price low** - Tops can also be seen on a stock's daily chart in the form of "arrows" pointing down.

3. **Third- or fourth-stage bases** - Sell when your stock makes a new high in price off a third or fourth stage base.

4. **Signs of a poor rally** - When you see initial heavy selling near the top, the next recovery will follow through weaker in volume, show poor price recovery, or last fewer days.

5. **Decline from the peak** - After a stock declines 8% or so from its peak, in some cases examination of the previous run-up, the top, and the decline may help you determine whether the advance is over or whether a normal 8% or 15% correction is in progress.

6. **Poor relative strength** - Poor relative price strength can be another reason for selling.

7. **Lone Ranger** - Consider selling if there is no confirming price strength by any other important member of the same industry group.

## Breaking Support

Breaking support occurs when stocks close for the week below established major trend lines.

1. **Long-term uptrend line is broken** - Sell if a stock closes at the end of the week below a major long-term uptrend line or breaks a key price support area on overwhelming volume.

2. **Greatest one-day price drop** - If a stock has already made an extended advance and suddenly makes its greatest one-day price drop since the beginning of the move, considered selling if the move is confirmed by other signals.

3. **Falling price on heavy weekly volume** - In some cases, sell if a stock breaks down on the largest weekly volume in its prior several weeks.

4. **200-day moving average line turns down**

5. **Living below the 10-week moving average** - Consider selling if a stock has a long advance, then closes below its 10-week moving average and lives below that average for 8 or 9 consecutive weeks, unable to rally and close the week above the line.

## When to Be Patient and Hold a Stock

In few cases, you may have to allow 13 weeks after your first purchase before you conclude that a stock that has not moved is a dull, faulty section.

After a new purchase, draw a defensive sell line in red on a daily or weekly graph at precise price level at which you will sell and cut your loss (8% or less below your buy point).

Once your stock is 15% or more above your purchase price, you can begin to concentrate on the price where or under what rules you will sell it on the way up or nail down your profit.

Dont' take profits during the first 8 weeks of a move unless the stock gets into serious trouble or is having a two or three week climax run up on a stock split in a late stage bases.

Stock that show a 20% profit in less than 8 weeks should be held through the eight weeks unless they are of poor quality without institutional sponsorship or strong group action.

You can't become a big winner in the market until you learn to be a good seller as well as a good buyer.
