# Financial Statement

## Revenue

They represent accounting dollars generated for business products sold or services performed.

## Cost of sales

A company's income statement shows how profitable a company's core operations are by indicating the revenue generated from sales of a product or service and then deducting the costs associated with the company's product of services.

## Gross margin

Gross margin or gross profit, is the difference between a company's total sales and its cost of sales.

## Selling, general, and administrative

A section of every income statement itemizes a series of expenses called operating expenses. It includes sales, running the business, keeping headquarters, marking, data processing, and administrating operations.

## Research and development

The type of operating expense in common and essential in pharmaceutical and technologies companies, which need to make ongoing investments in future products.

## Interest and taxes

Interest and taxes are the corporate world's equivalent of the proverbial sure things. Interest income come primary from cash and short-term investments reflected on the balance sheet. Interest expense comes, again not surprisingly, from short and long term debt balances.

## Balanace Sheet

Many investors and business analysts look closely for the following information in a balance sheet:

* The absolute and relative size of the numbers

* The makeup of assets, liabilities, and owner's equity

* Trends

* Valuation (assessing whether stated values reflect actual values)

## Cash and cash equivalents

TO assign value to accounts receivable, pay attention to the following factors:

* Size of accounts receivable relative to sales and other assets

* Trends in accounts receivable

* Quality of accounts receivable

## Fixed assets

The balance sheet entry called property, plant, and equipment is pretty clear name. It refers to the fixed assets - land, buildings, machinery, fixtures, office, and computers equipment and similar items - owned by the firm for productive use.

## Long-term liabilities

Long-term corporate liabilities are really no different than those in personal finance: they represent contracted commitments to pay back a sum of money over time, with interest.

## Owner's equity

This capital is in turn converted into an asset and then in turn converted into revenue and profit to produce a return to the owner.

Value investors talk about three different book value measures:

* Book value as owner's equity: total book assets minus liabilities

* Tangible book value: total book value minus all of part of intangibles.

* Book value per share: accounting book value divided by the number of common shares outstanding.

## Statement of Cash Flows

* Cash flow from operations

* Cash flow from investing activities

* "Free" Cash flow

* Cash flow from financing activities
