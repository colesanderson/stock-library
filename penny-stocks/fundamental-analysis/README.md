# Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis considers and interprets just about every factor that impacts a company. This represents 80 percent of the focus of Leeds Analysis and is the most important part of finding high-quality penny stocks with great upside potential.

When performing Leeds Analysis on the fundamentals of a penny stock, here is how we proceed:

- Look at the financial results (gives an understanding of the operational situation).
- Look for trends compared to previous quarters and years.
- Generate financial ratios (gives much deeper understanding).
- Compare financial ratios to previous quarters and years.
- Explore other fundamentals considerations (those not related to the financials).

There are also differences among various industries. To be considered strong, a technology company will have very different numbers than a biotech company. For example, it's rare for a biotech to be making any profit at all , while a utility company will generally be profitable. A high-growth company in a high-growth industry can have a share price that is 100 times it's earnings, while the share price of a company in a low-growth industry should be closer to 10 times earnings.

You will gain all the clarity you need by:

- Comparing the company's numbers to previous quarters and annual results
- Comparing the company's numbers to direct competitors and the overall industry
- Using financial ratios
- Comparing those ratios to competitors and the overall industry
- Using your own logic (e.g. revenues of 1 million with expenses of 20 million is really quite a problem!)
