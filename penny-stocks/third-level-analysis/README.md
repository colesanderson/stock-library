# Third Level Analysis

Third Level Analysis is generally conducted after both fundamental and technical research. It's actually with an understanding of the major concepts in Third Level Analysis, such as branding, positioning, and differentiation, that you will be able to uncover many potential investment opportunities.

## Overview

Fundamental analysis considers the strength of a company, and technical analysis looks for buying opportunities. The other step is Third Level Analysis and it reviews any miscellaneous and abstract facts of a company that could come into play.

Third Level Analysis reviews aspects of each stock such as:

- Branding
- Positioning
- Differentiation
- Habits/personal life of management
- Brain drain/employee poaching
- Management accessibility

## Branding

Think of Harley Davidson. A lot companies selling motorcycles, but people gladly join the waiting list for a new Harley because that's the only hog they will ever consider riding.

Every company has a certain degree of branding, albeit usually on a lower level than Harley. Picture a small technology startup. What are its customers saying about the company's software? What are its competitors saying? What was your experience with the company's software? Its customer service? Its prices? Its tech support? These facts all go into the pot, and cook up the company's overall branding experience.

You will want to find companies that have strong branding:

- In positive and effective
- Encourages word-of-mouth referrals
- Generates good connotations about the company
- Helps add to the company's market share

## Positioning

Indian Motorcycles couldn't compete with Harley in terms of market shares, so the company positioned itself as a more expensive, premium bike. In positioning itself to capture the market of high-end motorcycles buyers the company has claimed a niche that not even HD will be able to break into.

When most people think of safety in cars, they think about Volvo and willing to pay a higher price.

All companies are affected by positioning, whether they know it or not. Most CEOs and in fact most marketing and salespeople don't really know about or properly understanding positioning. This results in missed opportunities, wasted capital, and loss of market share.

## Differentiation

When a market is saturated with competition, differentiation becomes very important. There are hundred of options for weight loss, or stock picks, or clothes. How do products and services stand out above the noise and thereby make enough money to survive? They need to differentiate and make the difference easily and readily known.

What is difference between Google and Yahoo? Google is a pure-play search engine, meaning that it mainly does search.

By differentiating, both Google and Yahoo avoided going head-to-head, and instead the two of them gobbled up massive market share from all the other players in the industry.

Think of it this way: In a small town there might be enough business for three restaurants, but there is only enough customers for one Italian place, one Chinese place, and one steak house. A second steak house would instantly put the future of both steak houses in jeopardy because there were not differentiated well enough.

Differentiation is the key to survival in any market that is competitive or crowded.

## Habits/Personal Life of Management

An alcoholic CEO can run a company into the ground by the time he remembers where he was last night. A mother of five who is expecting a sixth may not make for a good CFO, assuming that the pregnancy and raising the children distract her from the corporate duties.

While it is difficult to learn everything you would want to know about the management team, you will be able to learn some things.

Publicly traded companies make it known who their management players are, and often give good write-ups on the web site.

You could look deeper into each of them online, perhaps through social networking sites, or doing search engine queries, such as Google news searches for their names.

## Brain Drain/Employee Poaching

Sometimes a smaller player has all the brains it needs, but cannot yet afford to pay very compelling salaries. That's when a bigger competitor with deep pockets swoops in and scoops up all the talent. It gives a competitive advantages to the bigger company, and it also gets the inside knowledge that the employee carries with him to the new job.

Especially in the technology companies, look for strong employee loyalty, competitive salaries, and reasons that the key players won't be stolen away.

Look at their main competitors, specifically at the employees. Where did most of the staff work before they were at this new job? Was it for the company that you are looking into? Speak to the Investor Relations contact at the competition, and ask her where her employees are mainly coming from. Get an idea if there is some pretty severe employee poaching. Sometimes, especially in technology companies, but potentially in any king of corporation, brain drain can be running wild.
