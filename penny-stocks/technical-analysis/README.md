# Technical Analysis

The next step is to get those companies at the best prices and at the perfect time.

In general, technical analysis has had varying degrees of success for investors of all skill levels, and with stocks of all sizes. One of the major problems of using the past to identify the future is the past patterns and trends can change at any time.

## General Range

By drawing a couple of quick lines on a trading chart, you can usually find a penny stock's general range.

This general range, while it can change at any time, can serve as a way of knowing what to expect from the underlying penny stock.

This pattern can be established due to support and resistance levels, or simply as a result of general trading activity.

## Current Trend

Think of a massive ocean tanker - it takes a lot of energy to change direction, or even to slow down. Stocks that are trending can be somewhat like ship in our analogy. While investments can change direction much more quickly, at any point in time they are most likely to keep going in the direction they are currently moving.

By getting in on a good uptrend early, you could profit significantly and over a long timeframe.

If the shares have two up days from every down day, then expect that the stock is in a uptrend. This will hold true as long as the total increase from the two up days is greater than the decrease from the single day.

## Trend Reversal

Uptrends and downtrends can drag on from months to years, but eventually they do end. This may result in the stock trading erratically with no clear trading range or direction, thus giving you fewer clues as to potential future price action.

To spot a reversal, look for indicators in the momentum of the stock, as well as the trading activity.

Trend Reversal Indicators:

- 2 up days for every 1 down day
- Expanding volume

## Trading Activity and Volume Considerations

Trading volume can help you identify some of the various technical patterns described in this book, but it's also an excellent technical indicator simply by itself.

Usually with increase in trading activity, unless it's major selloff for fundamental reasons, penny stocks usually benefit. They are exposed to higher interest.

On the other hand, if volume is drying up, especially if it is approaching almost nonexistent levels, you should be concerned.

## Support Levels

Some penny stocks enjoy support levels, which are prices the shares are less likely to fall below, due to buying pressure.

Often there is corresponding volume increase whenever shares approach the support. This is because a lot buyers have "gathered" around that certain price, which has therefore created the support line.

## Resistance Levels

This is precisely the opposite of support levels. Resistance levels are caused by increase in selling activity at a certain price, making it difficult for the shares to rise above that level. While the shares can sometimes break through and then move on to higher prices, it's more likely that they will hit that ceiling and drop back down.

For this reason, resistance levels can often be a great point to take profits.

If a stock does finally break above the very solid resistance level, that price often becomes a support level.

## Dips

Sometimes a penny stock drop sharply by 10 to 30 percent, or more, but the dip is based simply on a temporary lack of buying demand (or a sudden increase in the amount of selling volume).

A true dip is temporary in nature, often disappearing with in hours or a couple of days at the most, and represents tremendous buying opportunity.

## Collapse

A collapse look exactly like a dip, except for one major and important difference: it is permanent.

A typical timeline of a collapse:

- weakness in the share prices leading up to the collapse
- sudden and dramatic fall in the stock
- often the fall is so severe that there is a gap between the pre-collapse and post-collapse prices.
- trading volume is several times the average.
- following two to five days sees the price drop even further.
- volume is still above average on these days, but not as high as the first day.

## Temporary Spike

I have seen temporary spikes in companies from all different sectors and industries. They  are usually fueled by an FDA approval, an appearance at a convention, a major contract win, or any other noteworthy success. Sudden buying pressure sends the stock higher.

The rise is dramatic, unexpected and fast. Unfortunately, it is also temporary. If you miss your chance on temporary spike and you will miss your excellent exit opportunity and will need to wait months or years.

## Permanent Spike

When a fundamental factor, such as a new contract win, drives the stock price higher, it may cause a Permanent spike.

A permanent spike can send a stock to 50 to 100 percent higher in a day, but sometimes it happen more gradually, and often takes place in 10 and 30 percent move over the course of few weeks.

The following is true of temporary spikes:

- Further gradual price increase from day to day.
- Gradual increase in trading volume.
- The trading volume remains high for weeks.
- They have minor increases in price on any given day.
- Minor price increases add up to result in a major price advance overall.
- They last indefinitely and may be followed up by another permanent spike taking shares to an even higher level.  

## Topping Out

After a steep or long-term rise, shares may begin to trade flat, giving the look of a plateau on a mountain top.

As the daily trading mix goes from begin driven by buyers to driven by sellers.

## Bottoming Out

Bottoming out usually lasts for many months, and the pattern almost always takes far longer to play out than a typical topping out scenario.
