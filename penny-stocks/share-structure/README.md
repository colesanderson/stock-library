# Share Structure

Companies raise money through the sale of their shares. They also leverage the shares to acquire other companies and assets. The downside is when they go too far, as so many companies do, and dilute their shares.

Each share represents one unit of ownership of a company. Picture ABC Corp. worth about 1 million. Now, if it had only 1 share outstanding, that share would likely trade for about 1 million. If there were 10 shares outstanding, those shares would trade for about $100,000 each, so total will be 1 million.

If investors think the company is worth more, then they pay more for shares, thus driving the share price up, and therefore the overall company's value.

The higher the value of the shares:

- The more money a company can raise.
- The fewer newly issued shares needed to raise that money
- The more buying power a company has for acquisitions.

## Insider Trade / Insider Holdings

There are two versions of insider trading. One is legal and serves as good indicator of management's faith in their own company. The other is not legal, and involves taking advantage of information to which average investors have not yet been alerted.

The theory is that insider buying is a positive sign, while insider selling is a negative sign.

When I look at insider trading from the perspective of Leeds Analysis, I do not use it as an indicator of the future share price direction. Rather, it complements my findings about management - specifically, its speak to their level of commitment and optimism.

## Institutional Holdings

Often, big chunks of the outstanding shares are owned by other corporations. It may be:

- Competitors, trying to hedge against their own successes and failures by owning a piece of the competition.
- Bigger, cash-rich corporation looking for places to invest.
- Companies looking to potentially take over the business in question and keeping their fingers in the pie.
- Mutual funds or hedge funds that believe the share will increase in value.

Institutional holdings are freely disclosed and you can check them quite easily online with sites like Yahoo Finance. In general, greater institutional holdings, with a greater number of institutions, demonstrate that professional analysts and money managers and/or industry allies and competitors, believe that the shares represent a good investment.

## Dilution

Dilution is when a company issues more shares, thus making the value of each share worth a little bit less. In theory, doubling the number of outstanding shares cut the value of all the outstanding shares in half.

Unfortunately, in most cases companies are issuing the shares because their business model is burning up cash. If they spit out more shares every time they need to raise money, they will dilute the value of the shares.

## Buybacks

This is the opposite of dilution. Often a cash-rich company feels that the market is not fairly valuing the shares, so it buys back stock on the open market. These shares are then retired (meaning they will no longer exist), which makes the value of the remaining shares greater.

Share buybacks do several things:

- They usually help the share price, since buybacks are often a positive development for shares.
- The trading price of the shares will probably increase as the demand is greater.
- Share that are purchased get retired, making the value of each of remaining shares greater.
- They demonstrate a belief by management that shares are undervalued.

## Acquisitions

Companies often leverage their shares, although they sometimes use cash as well, to acquire another company. Usually it's a much bigger corporation scooping up a smaller one, but this is not always the case.

The reasons one company may acquire another can be to:

- Get the personnel
- Have ownership of the patents, technologies, or intellectual property
- Gain the customer base
- Gain the brand or name
- Increase revenues
- Generate company growth
- Take them out as a competitor
- Gain a resource land claim

In general being acquired will increase the share price of the company, because the larger company usually needs to pay a premium for the shares.

For example, to acquire a company whose stock is trading at $4.25, the bidder may need to pay closer to $6.00 per share to entice current shareholders to give up their investment.
