# 21 Costly Common Mistakes Most Investors Make

1. **Stubbornly holding onto your losses when they are very small and reasonable**

Always cut all your losses immediately when a stock falls 7% or 8% below your purchase price.

2. **Buying on the way down in price, thus ensuring miserable results**

3. **Averaging down in price rather than averaging up when buying**

4. **Not learning to use charts and being afraid to buy stocks that are going into new high ground off sound bases**

5. **Never getting out of the starting gate properly because of poor selection criteria and not knowing exactly what to look for in a successful company**

6. **Not having specific general market rules to tell when a correction in the market is beginning or when a market decline is most likely over a new uptrend is confirmed**

7. **Not following your buy or sell rules, causing you to make an increased number of mistakes**

8. **Concentrating your effort on what to buy and, once the buy decision is made, not understanding when or under what conditions the stock must be sold**

9. **Failing to understand the importance of buying high-quality companies with good institutional sponsorship and the importance of learning how to use charts to significantly improve selection and timing**

10. **Buying more shares of low-priced stocks rather than fewer shares of higher-priced stocks**

11. **Buying on tips, rumors, split announcements, and other news events; stories; advisory-services recommendation; or opinions you hear from other people or from supposed market experts on TV**

12. **Selecting second-rate stocks because of dividends or low price/earnings ratios**

13. **Wanting to make a quick and easy buck**

14. **Buying old names you are familiar with**

15. **Not being able to recognize (and follow) good information and advice**

16. **Cashing in small, easy-to-take profits while holding the losers.**

17. **Worrying way too much about taxes and commissions**

18. **Speculating too heavily in options or future because you see them as a way to get rich quick**

19. **Rarely transacting "at the market", preferring instead to put price limits on buy and sell orders**

20. **Not being able to make up your mind when a decision needs to be made**

21. **Not looking at stocks objectively**
