# Money Management: Should You Diversify, Invest for the Long Haul, Use Margin, Sell Short, or Buy Options, IPOs, Tax Shelters, Nasdaq Stocks, Foreign Stocks, Bonds, or Other Assets?

## How Many Stocks Should You Really Own?

Most people with $20,000 to $200,000 to invest should consider limiting themselves to four or five carefully chosen stocks they know and understand.

If you have $5,000 to $20,000 to invest, three stocks might be reasonable to maximum. A $3,000 account could be confined to two equities.

Keep things manageable. The most stocks you own, the harder it  is to keep track of all of them.

## How to Spread Your Purchases over Time

In a bull market, one way to maneuver your portfolio toward to more concentrated positions is to follow up your initial buy and make one or two smaller additional buys in stocks as soon as they have advanced 2% to 3% above your initial buy.  

Sell and eliminate stocks that start to show losses before they become big losses.

Always set a limit on how many stocks you will own, and stick to your rules.

## Should You Invest for the Long Haul?

Let your rules and the market decide which one is short or long haul.

If you do this, some of your winners will be held of three months, some six months, and a few for one, two, or three years or more. Most of your losers will be held for much shorter periods, normally between a few weeks and three months.

No well-run portfolio should ever, ever have losses carried for six months or more.

## Should You Sell Short?

Short selling is still a topic few investors understand and an endeavor at which even fewer succeed, so consider carefully whether it's right for you.

What is short selling? Think of it as reversing the normal buy and sell process. In Short selling, you sell a stock (instead of buying it) - even though you don't own it and therefore must borrow from your broker - in the hope that it will go down in price instead of up. If the stock falls in price as you expect, you can "cover your short position" by buying the stock in the open market at a lower price and pocket the difference as your profit.

In selling short, you also have to minimize your risk by cutting your losses at 8%. Otherwise, the sky's the limit as your stock could have an unlimited price increase.

My first rule in short selling: don't sell short during a bull market.

Second rule is: never sell short a stock with a small number of shares outstanding. It's safer to short stocks that are trading an average daily volume of 5 to 10 million shares or more.

Best chart price patterns for selling short is:

1. Head-and-shoulders top.

2. Third- or fourth-stage cup-with-handle or other patterns that have definitely failed after attempted breakouts.

## What are Options, and Should You Invest in Them?

Options are an investment vehicle where you purchase rights (contracts) to buy ("call") or sell ("put") a stock, stock index, or commodity at specified price before a specified future time, known as the option expiration date.

Options are very speculative and involve substantially greater risks and price volatility than common stocks.

Options are like making "all or nothing" bets.

### Limiting Your Risk when it Comes to Options

If you do considered options, you should definitely limit the percentage of your total portfolio committed to them. A prudent limit might be no more than 10% to 15%. The percentage will naturally have to be more than 8%, since options are much more volatile than stocks.

### Buy Only the Best

When I buy options, which is rarely, I prefer to buy them for the most aggressive and outstanding stocks with the biggest earnings estimates, those where the premium you have to pay for the option is higher.

Once again, you want options on the best stocks, not the cheapest.
In a major bear market, you might consider buying put options on certain individual stocks or on a major stock index like S%P, along with selling shares of common stock short.

If you think a stock is going up and it's the right time to buy, then buy it, or purchase a long term option and place your order at the market. If it is time to sell, sell at the market.

### Short-Term Options Are More Risky

If you buy options, you are better off with longer time periods, say, six months or so. This will minimize the change your option will run out of time before your stock has had a change to perform.

Now I have told you this, what do you think of most investors do? Of course, they buy shorter-term option - 30 to 90 days - because these options are cheaper and move faster in both directions, up and down!

### Keep Option Trading Simple

One thing to keep in mind is that you should always keep your investments as simple as possible. Don't let someone talk to you into speculating in such seemingly sophisticated packages as strips, straddles, and spreads. 

## Should You Buy Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)?

An initial public offering is a company's first offering of stock to the public. I don't recommended that investors purchase IPOs.
