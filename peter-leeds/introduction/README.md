## Market versus Limit Orders

To buy or sell shares, there are two types or trading orders:

1. Market orders
2. Limit orders

Market order: You trade the stock at the currently best available price.

Limit order: You specify the price you are willing to pay.

It's always best with penny stocks to use limit orders rather than market orders, and this applies for both buying and selling.

If you buy with a market order, you might end up paying more than you had wanted to. When it comes to penny stocks, beginning traders should only use and always use limit orders.
