# Penny Stocks

## Goal:

My goal is to figure out how to scan the potential breakout penny stocks. I will need to develop checklist to make sure all the stocks that I pick have checked all the checklists. I will need to organize all resources so I can easily find what I am looking for at few minutes rather than few hours figuring out where to find for what I am looking for.
