## Breaking Down Microeconomics versus Macroeconomics

### Microeconomics

Looking at the economic small picture such as the fundamentals of a company

* Financial life such as sales, expenses, profit, debt, etc.

    Eg. You have lots debt (liabilities) and very little in the way of things you own (assets), then your net worth is negative and the microeconomics of your household are not good at all.

### Macroeconomics

Looking at the economic big picture, such as the health of the general economy - in Canada, the U.S., and the world wide.

* One of the most helpful Macroeconomics indicators is the index of Leading Economic Indicators (LEI), which is an economic gauge that covers a broad array of statistics intended to estimate future economic activity in the U.S.

## Supply and demand

We count on supply and demand to tell us how well a product or service will sell. This in turn tells us whether the company providing the supply has enough customers (demand) to be profitable and successful.

## Dynamic analysis versus static analysis

**Dynamic analysis** takes human behavior into account. It takes into account how people or organizations at differently given incentives (such as discounts) or disincentives (such as sales, taxes), while **static analysis** doesn't.

## Politics and Investing

| Possible Legislation   | Effect on Investing            |
| :--------------------: | :----------------------------: |
| Taxes | Generally, more or higher taxes ultimately have a negative impact on stock investing. Income taxes and capital gains taxes are good examples. |
| Laws | Price controls - laws that set the price of a product, service, or commodity - are examples of negative laws. |
| Regulations | Generally, more or tougher regulations have a negative impact on stocks. |
| Government spending and debt | If government agencies spend too much or misallocate resources, they may create greater burdens on society, which in turn will be bearish for the economy and the stock market. |
| Money supply | The money supply - the dollars you use - is controlled by the Bank of Canada. Affect stock BIG time. Increasing or decreasing the money supply results in either inflationary or a deflationary environment, which can help or hurt the economy, specific industries and stock picks. |
| Interest rates | The Bank of Canada and Federal Reserve in the U.S. have crucial influence here. It can raise or lower key interest rates that in turn can have an effect on the entire economy and the stock market. When interest rates go up, it makes credit more expensive for companies. When interest rate go down, the companies can get cheaper rates. |

## Nonsystemic and systemic effects

**Nonsystemic effect** The system is not affected but a particular participant is affected.

**Systemic effect** All the players in the system are affected.


## What Government reports to watch for?

**GDP** Gross Domestic Product, which measures a nation's total output of goods and services for the quarter, is considered the broadest measure of economic activity.

* Over 3 percent: strong growth - if 5 percent or higher, the economy is sizzling!

* 1 to 3 percent: moderate growth and can occur either as the economy is rebounding or slowing down from previously strong period.
* 0 or negative percent: number is not good, economy is either not growing or shrinking.

* Under -3 percent: Very low, and economy is bad. If under -3 percent for 2 or more quarters and it can cause serious recession.

**Unemployment**

This information gives investors a snapshot of the health and productivity of the economy.

**The Consumer Price Index**

The Customer Price Index (CPI) is a statistic that tracks the prices of a representative basket of goods and services on a monthly basis.
