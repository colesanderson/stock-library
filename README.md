## What is Dividends?

Dividends are payments made to an owner (unlike interest, which is payments to a creditor). Dividends are great source of income and companies that issue dividends tend to have more stable stock price.

## What is Yield?

Yield is an investment payout expressed as a percentage of the investment amount. Looking at the yield is a way to compare the income you expect to recieve from one investment with the expected income from others.

`dividend yield = annual dividend per share / stock's price per share`

> `CPG` Stock Trade is at `$15.30`

> Dividend Yield is at `7.11%`

> `x / $15.30 = 7.11`

> `$15.30 * 7.11% = $108.78`

> `$108.78` is company annal dividend

**Call**

A call option is a bet that particular stock (or exchange-traded fund) will go up during the file of the option.

**Put**

A put option is a bet that particular stock (or exchange-traded fund) will go down during the life of the option.

Think of the following rule of thumb:

* If the stock goes up 10 percent, a call option on that stock could go up 20 percent. Of course, a put option on the same stock would lose 20 percent.

* If the stock goes down 10 percent, a call could go down 20 percent. Of course, a put option on that same stock would gain 20 percent.

* If the stock stays flat or neutral, both call and put options would start to lose value because options have finite life and can potentially be worthless by the time they expire.
