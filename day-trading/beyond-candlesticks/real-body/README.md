# The Real Body

The real body is the essence of the price movement. This is a critical and powerful aspect of candle charts; through the height and color of the real body, candle charts clearly and quickly display the relative posture of the bulls and the bears.

## Long White Real Bodies

A long white real body is defined as a session that opens at or near the low of session, and then closes at or near the session's high. The close should be much higher than the open.

### Long White at a Low Price Level

A single candle by itself is rarely sufficient reason to forecast an immediate reversal. It could, however, be one clue that the prior trend may be changing.

### Long White Candle Confirms Support

The tall white candle that rebounds from support underscores the aggressiveness of the bulls. A long white candle that bounces off a support area such as trend line, a moving average, or retracement level gives extra confirmation of that support.

## Long White Body Breaks Resistance

Tall white candle confirmed an important breakout from the aforementioned resistance band.

## Long White Real Bodies as Support

Brings out one of the more exciting uses of long white candles, specifically, that long white candles can become support areas.

## Long Black Real Body at High Price Area

Just as a long white candle could be an early signal that the market may be trying to build a bottom, so it is that a distinctively long black real body at a high price may be a tentative warning of a top.

The longer the rally continued and the more overbought the market, the more reliable the cautionary signal of this long black real body becomes.

## Long Black Confirms Resistance

The market backs off sharply from resistance through a long black candle, it is extra confirmation of resistance area. This is because such a candle means that either the bulls have retreated or that the bears have become aggressive enough to overwhelm the bulls.

## Long Black Breaks Support

The way the market breaks a support area may indicate the seriousness of the break.

For instance, a move under a support area by way of a long black candle should be viewed as a potentially more bearish scenario than if the market closes under a support area with a short black candle or a white candle.

## Long Black as Resistance

As a long white real body acts as a support area, so a long black real body should act as resistance.

A long white candle gives us a support area 50% within its real body. Consequently, a pullback to near the 50% retracement of the long white could be used as an early buying zone.

## Size, Frequency, and Color of Real Bodies

The tone of the market can be gauged by comparing the relative height, frequency, and color of a group of candle lines.

The first sign of trouble came with the long black candle at (1). Note how this is the longest black candle in some time. Then, an appearance of an elongated black candle at (2) was evident warning sign of trouble.

## Opening Compared to Prior Real Body

A disadvantage of candle charts is that they require the close to complete the candle line. Another mechanism to bypass waiting for the close, and the one I will focus on here, is comparing the opening to the prior real body.

If the opening is under the midpoint of the previous white real body, it could be a bearish scenario. Conversely, if the next day's opening is above the black body's midpoint, it could be viewed as positive sign.

## Spinning Tops

We have seen the power inherent in tall white or black real bodies. A tall white body reflects a strong session in which the bulls are in control, whereas a long black real body means that the bears are in charge.

A spinning top is a warning sign that the market is losing its momentum. If the market is at or near a new high, especially after a steep advance, the emergence of a spinning top could be a signal the bulls are having trouble in continuing their ascent.

## Doji

One of the more important individual candlestick lines is the doji. A doji session has horizontal line instead of a real body. This is because a doji is formed when the session's open and close are the same.

At such a time, the Japanese say that a doji provides a hint of tops and bottoms.

While the doji can mean the market may reverses its prior trend, traders should view the doji as echoing a market in transition rather than being an outright reversal pattern. Based on this, traders should wait until the next session or two after the doji to show them which way the market will move.

## Shadows

While the real body is often considered the most important segment of the candle, there is also substantial information to be gleaned from the length and position of the shadows.

A tall upper shadow is especially important when it appears at a high price level, at a resistance area, or when the market is overbought.

This is because such a candle line would hint that there is either heavy supply entering at higher prices or an evaporation of buying.
