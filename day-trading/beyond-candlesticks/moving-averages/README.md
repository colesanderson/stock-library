# How The Japanese Use Moving Averages

Based on my work and discussions with Japanese traders, it appears that the most powerful moving averages are the 5-, 9-, or 25-day averages for shorter term traders, and for longer term traders, the 13-, 26-week or the 75- and 200-day moving averages.

## The Golden And Dead Cross

The Japanese use dual moving averages in which they compare short and long term averages.

If a shorter term moving averages crosses over the longer term moving averages, it is viewed as a bullish sign. The Japanese call such as crossover "a golden cross".

A "dead cross" is a bearish indication that occurs when a short-term moving averages crosses under the longer term moving averages.
