## The Hanging Man

A hanging man has a very long lower shadow, a small real body (white or black) near the upper of the trading range and little or no upper shadow.

However, as expressed in the Japanese literature, "If it appears from below, buy, and if appears from above, sell".

The hanging man line is a top reversal signal that must arrive during a rally, while the hammer is a bottom reversal line that must appear during a decline; the same line can be bullish or bearish, depending on the trend preceding it.

The small real body of the handing man also shows the prior uptrend may be in the process of changing. Because of the bullish action of the hanging man session, an important aspect of the hanging man lines is that there should be bearish confirmation.

## The Shooting Star

A session with a long upper shadow and a small real body near the bottom end of the trading range is called a shooting star.

Just as the long lower shadow of a hammer is bullish, so the long upper shadow of the shooting star is bearish.

The long upper shadow means that the bears have been able to sharply drag prices back from their highs.
