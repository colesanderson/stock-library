# Record Sessions

Most candle patterns are composed of one, two or three candles. This aspect shows one of the major advantages of the candle charts - they can often send a reversal signal in only a few sessions, where bar charts can take much longer.

One of these longer term pattern techniques is the eight to ten record sessions.

In candle theory, when there are eight to ten record sessions, it increases the possibility that the preceding trend will change.

The theory of record high sessions is that during a rally, a trader should stop buying after eight to ten record session highs. The same philosophy, but in reverse, should be considered after a decline with eight to ten record session lows.

The reason the record sessions should be almost consecutive has to do with the underlying concept of record sessions. In the case of eight to ten record session highs (lows), the market becomes overbought (oversold).
