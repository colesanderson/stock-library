# Dual Candle Lines

## Dark Cloud Cover

A dark cloud shows, as the Japanese express it, that the market has a poor chance of rising. The dark cloud cover's first candle is strong white session. During the nest session, there is buying pressure left over an the market opens higher, but later in that session, prices decline as the market closes under the center of the previous session.

The dark cloud displays pictorially a time in the market in which selling pressure is exceeding the buying pressure.

An ideal dark cloud cover's second session should close under the midpoint of the prior white candle.

A dark cloud often becomes resistance.

## The Piercing Pattern

The piercing pattern is the opposite of the dark cloud cover.

The dark cloud cover appears after an uptrend, and is comprised of a black real body that closes well into prior white body.

The piercing pattern is a white real body that closes within the prior black real body.

The pattern shows that there is fierce buying at lower levels.

If the white candle fails to move deeply into the black candle, it reflects a weak counterattacks by the bulls and selling could resume.

## The Engulfing Patterns

A bullish engulfing pattern is formed when, during a downtrend, a white real body wraps around a black real body.

A bearish engulfing pattern is completed when, during a rally, a black real body envelops a white real body.

The engulfing pattern visually shows how the opposing forces had gained control of the market.

The basic definition of an engulfing pattern is that the second real body must engulf an opposite color real body.

## Last Engulfing Patterns

A bearish engulfing pattern is a large black candle that envelops a small white real body after a uptrend.

If a bearish engulfing pattern appears during a price decline, it has the potential of being a bullish bottom reversal signal.

The last engulfing pattern is viewed as a turning point for the bulls if the price can close above the black candle's close.
