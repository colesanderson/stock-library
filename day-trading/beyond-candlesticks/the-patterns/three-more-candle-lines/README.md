# Three Or More Candle Lines

## The Evening Star

The evening star is three-candlestick pattern. The criteria for this pattern include an up-trending market in which a long white candle is followed by a small real body. The small read body of the second candle line can be a black or white and should not touch the real body of candle 1. The third candle of this pattern is a black real body that does not usually touch real body 2, and then closes well into white candle line that makes up the first candle of this pattern.

It's important to wait for the third line to get the bearish confirmation of this pattern.

I use the highest point of the three candles, that form the evening star that is, the top of the highest upper shadows, as my resistance.

## The Morning Star

The classic morning star has none of the three real bodies that make up the pattern touching.

How to determine if you should trade from a less than ideal pattern? Based on the Japanese literature, may conversations with Japanese candle traders, and my experience, here are a few suggestions:

1. Wait for more confirmation of that pattern's predictions.
2. If the less than ideal pattern confirms a support or resistance area, or if it appears in a very oversold or overbought market, the greater the odds that the pattern will be a reversal.
3. A method you may find useful in helping to determine the significance of a less than ideal pattern is to make a blended candle from that pattern.
