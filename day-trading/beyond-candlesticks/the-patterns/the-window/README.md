# The Window

The window, also known as disjointed candles, is one of the more powerful candlesticks patterns.

Rising Windows, the top of yesterday's upper shadow should be under the low of the today's lower shadow.

Falling Window, that the low of yesterday's session is above the top of today's upper shadow.

Windows are a good visual clue because they clearly display that the action and market sentiment is one-sided.

The risk in waiting for a close to confirm the break of window is that, by the time this happens, the market may be sharply higher or lower than you may have wanted to risk:

1. Waiting for a closing price to confirm the break of a window's support or resistance area;
2. How volume can influence the importance of a window;
3. Using windows to confirm a trend reversal;
4. How windows can provide a quick clue to the market's health;
5. Waiting for three sessions for confirmation of a window;
6. Three windows and confirmation of a trend reversal;
7. Two black gapping candles;
8. Gapping doji.

## Three Windows

The Japanese view a market that has had three rising or falling windows in a row as a market that has reached maturity. The market in such a scenario is viewed as being overextended and correction is likely.

It's my opinion, based on experience, that even if there are three windows in the same direction, I would not trade against the direction of these windows until I see more proof of a trend reversal.

## Two Black Gapping candles

While a falling windows is bearish, it is even more dangerous if the two candles immediately following the windows have black real bodies. It's called "two black gapping candles".

The dual black candles reinforce the face that the trend has turned from up to down.

## Gapping Doji

Gapping doji said this is a time where selling meets more selling and thus its bearish signal.

I would recommend waiting for confirmation for this pattern on the session after the doji.
