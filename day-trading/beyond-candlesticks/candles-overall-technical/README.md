# Candles And The Overall Technical Picture

You must consider the overall market condition before trading with the candles. Otherwise, you may be in for a "loss and ambush encounter".

The candles are a tool that must be incorporated with other trading guidelines.

By understanding and using these trading principles, you will be in a position to most fully enhance the power of the candles.

## Stops

There should always be a price at which you say your outlook is wrong.

The protective stop out level is that price. No matter, how reliable the technical tool, there will be times when the signal obtained from that tool is wrong.

In effect, the use of stop provides one of the most powerful aspects of technical analysis; it offers a risk management approach to the market.

## Risk/Reward

One of the most important aspects in determining the "right moment" for a trade is to inspect the risk/reward aspect of the market at the time then candle pattern is formed.

A stop, by defining the risk of a trade, is one of the components of the risk and reward picture. The other component is the price target of the trade, or the potential "reward".

## Trend

Determining where the most current price is in relation to the trend is of vital importance. This means that a candle pattern should be viewed in the context of the prevailing trend before deciding if a new position should be initiated.

There are many ways to determine trend. I will reveal some popular methods of trend determination used by Japanese traders and investors.

The goal of this section is not to help you find the best way to determine trend, but to get you to think about some ways to incorporate trend into your candle analysis.

## Becoming a Market Chameleon

When first placing a trade, you have expectations about how the market should act.

Adapting to changing market conditions is what I called being a "market chameleon".

Being a market chameleon, that is, quickly and effectively adapting to a new market environment, is a vital element to successful trading.
