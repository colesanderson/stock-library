# Setup a Profit vs Loss Ratio

A profit vs loss ratio is something that can be itself help you succeed investing in the stock market.

## What they are?

A profit vs loss ratio is a plan that you put in place to limit your downside exposure on all your trades to x%, while setting a target on your upside to x% return per trade.

## How to set up your ratio?

The best ratio and one that is recommended by CANSLIM is to utilize a **3 to 1** profit vs. loss ratio.

This means that we can be wrong twice then be right once and still make a profit.

Set your losses to a maximum of 7 to 8 percent each trade. When we buy our position we immediately place a **stop loss** order 7 to 8% below our purchase price.

On the upside we will see any stock after it is up between 20 to 25%.

**Example**

```
Buy 100 shares of a $20 stock, so $2,000 total

it goes down -7% (-$140)

to $18.60 (20 * -7%)

sell leaving you now to $1,860
```

```
Buy 100 shares of $18.60, so $1,860 total

it goes down -7% (-$130)

to $17.30 (18.60 * -7%)

sell leaving you now to $1,730
```

```
Buy 1000 shares of $17.30, so $1,730

it goes up +20% (+$340)

to $20.76 (17.30 * 20%)

sell leaving you now to $2,076
```
