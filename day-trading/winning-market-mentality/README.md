# The Winning Market Mentality That Leads to Profits

Two etched-in-stone rules to live by the rest of your trading list.

* Rule One: Protect your principal

* Rule Two: Trade to trade well (not to make money)

## Protect Your Principal

A successful trader, your tool consist of market knowledge, mental and emotional discipline, and your trading account. Protect the money in your trading account at all times. Do not abuse it, treat it carelessly, or allow others to take it from you. Guard it with passion and commitment.

Traders somewhere in the world are chasing a stock, ignoring their stops, holding losers, overtrading, taking home dangerous or oversized positions, and buying against a downtrend.

## Trade To Trade Well, Not To Make Money

Traders who routinely rake in big bucks don't mentally count the dollars while they are trading. They don't think, "Wow, I am up two points in Exxon. Let's see a thousand shares, times two dollars a share equals to $2,000".

From now on, your goal is not to make money. Your trading goal: Trade to trade well. As of this minute, banish money from your mind. Money represents the by-product of the art of good trading, and you will have plenty of time to count it at the end of the day.

## Why The Stock Market Is Always Right

A macrocosm of collective energy, the stock market expands and contracts with global news, company earnings, government reports, wars, weather, and more. Traders, investors, gurus, and analysts come participate and go and still the self-contained market continues.

Industries within the market inflate and deflate in value, depending on economics fundamentals or the fickle herd-mentality of market participants.

Please keep in mind the two phrases, the market is always right and the price is always right.
