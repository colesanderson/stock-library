# Stop Limit Order

Different types of orders allow you to be more specific about how you would like your broker to fulfill your trades.

When you place a stop or limit order, you are telling your broker that you don't want the market price but that you want the stock price to move in a certain direction before you order is executed.

## Stop order

Your trade will be executed only when the security you want to buy or sell reaches a particular price (the stop price).

Once the stock has reaches this price, a stop order essentially becomes a market order and is filled.

**Example**

```
Owns 20 shares of ABC stock

ABC currently trading at $20

Place a stop order to sell it at $15

The order will be made when stock hits to $15.

Known as "stop-loss order"
```

```
Owns 20 shares of XZY stock at $10

XZY now trading at $15

Placing a stop order at $15 will guarantee profits of $5 per share

Known as "stop-profit order"
```

## Limit order

Order that sets the maximum or minimum at which you are willing to buy or sell a particular stock.

**Example**

```
If I want to buy stock CDE

Currently trading at $12

Set a limit order at $10

Once the stock reaches to $10 or less, you will automatically buy CDE
```

```
Own 20 shares of FGH stock

Currently trading at $12

Place a limit order to sell it at $15

Once stock reaches to $15, the stock will be sold
```

## Stop-limit order

Order that becomes executable once a set price has been reached and is filled at the current market price.

**Example**

```
MNO is trading at $40

Investor put in a stop-limit order to buy the stop price at $45 and the limit price at $46.

If price of MNO moves above $45 stop price, the order is activated and turns into a limit order.
```
