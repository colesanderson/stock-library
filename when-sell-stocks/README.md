# When Sell Stocks

## Bernard Baruch's Secret Market Method of Making millions

You positively must understand and accept that the first rule of highly successful individual investor is always cut short and limit every single loss. To do this takes never-ending discipline and courage.

I like to follow 3 to 1 ratio between where to sell and take profits and where to cut loses. If you take some 20% and 25%, cut your loses at 7% to 8%. If you are in bear market like 2008 and you buy any stocks at all, you might get only a few 10% or 25% gains, so I would move quickly to cut every single loss automatically at 3%, with no expectations.

The whole secret to winning big in the stock market is not to be right all the time, but to lose the least amount possible when you are wrong.

## Are Successful People Lucky or Always Right?

Over the years, I have found that only one or two out of ten stocks that I have bought turned out to be truly outstanding and capable or making this kind of substantial profits.

## Always, without Exception, Limit Losses to 7% to 8% of Your Cost

Individual investors should definitely set firm rules limiting the loss on the initial capital they have invested in each stock to an absolute maximum of 7% to 8%.

If you use charts to time your buys precisely off sound bases (price consolidation areas), your stocks will rarely drop 8% from a correct buy point. So when they do, either you have made a mistake in your selection or a general market decline may be starting.

## All Common Stocks Are Speculative and Risky

There is considerable risk in all common stocks, regardless of their name, quality, purported blue-chip status, previous performance record, or current good earnings. Keep in mind that growth stocks can top at a time when their earnings are excellent and analysts estimates are still rosy.

What should you do if a stock gets away from you and the loss becomes greater than 10%? This can happen to anyone, and it's even more critical sign that the stock positively must be **sold**. The stock was in more trouble than normal, so it fell faster and further than normal. In the market collapse of 2000, many new investors lost heavily, and some of them lost it all. If they had just followed the simple sell rule discussed earlier, they would have protected most of their capital.

## Take Your Losses Quickly and Your Profits Slowly

The way to make investment decisions is to always (with no exceptions) take your losses quickly and your profits slowly.

Letting your losses run is the most serious mistake that almost all investors make. You must accept the fact that mistakes in stock selection and timing are going to be made frequently, even by the most experienced of professional investors.

## Should You Average Down in Price?

About the only thing that is worse is for brokers to take themselves off the hook by advising customers to "average down" (buy more of a stock that is already showing a loss).

## Analyzing Your Activities

At the end of each month or quarter, compute the percentage change in the price of each stock from the last date you did this type of analysis.

Write down the price at which you expect to sell if you have a loss along with the expected profit potential of all the securities you purchase.
